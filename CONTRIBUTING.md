# Contributing

Unless you explicitly state otherwise, any contribution intentionally
submitted for inclusion in the work by you, as defined in the Apache-2.0
license, shall be dual licensed as above, without any additional terms
or conditions.

All kinds of contributions are welcome, be it bug reports, testing, merge
requests, documentation improvements, reviewing the code or playing devils
advocate on the API design. The worst that can happen is differing opinions.

By default, the usual github fork & merge request workflow works, but patches
submitted in other ways are likely to be accepted (or at least discussed) as
well.
